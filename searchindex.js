However, unless you take a look at the definition of StrWrap , it is not clear that the returned value is actually borrowing something. Therefore, starting with edition 2018, it is deprecated, for non-reference-types (types other than & and &mut ), to leave off the lifetime parameters. Instead, where you previously wrote -> StrWrap , you should now, in edition 2018, write -> StrWrap<'_> . What exactly does '_ mean? It depends on the context! In output contexts, as in the return type of make_wrapper , it refers to a single lifetime for all \"output\" locations. In input contexts, a fresh lifetime is generated for each \"input location\". More concretely, to understand input contexts, consider the following example: struct Foo<'a, 'b: 'a> { field: &'a &'b str,\n} impl<'a, 'b: 'a> Foo<'a, 'b> { // some methods...\n} We can rewrite this as: #![feature(rust_2018_preview)] # struct Foo<'a, 'b: 'a> {\n# field: &'a &'b str,\n# } impl Foo<'_, '_> { // some methods...\n} This is the same, because for each '_ , a fresh lifetime is generated.

Finally, you may sense that various parts of the project lags behind, since they update at different paces. If a new language feature lands in Rust 1.15, a new chapter about it may land in the book in 1.16, and the IDE integration may land in 1.17. This can feel like the pieces are not well coordinated, but if you compare Rust 1.15 to Rust 1.17, you'll see one cohesive feature being added. \"Editions\" are a concept to help with these kinds of problems. Every two or three years, we'll be producing a new edition of Rust. This serves different purposes for different people: for those working on Rust, it's a great way to focus on looking at the project as a whole, and being able to see the big picture.

Meanwhile, impl Trait in return position are existentials (existentially quantified types). Okay, maybe that's a bit too jargon-heavy. Let's step back. Consider this function: fn foo<T: Trait>(x: T) { When you call it, you set the type, T . \"you\" being the caller here. This signature says \"I accept any type that implements Trait.\" (\"any type\" == universal in the jargon) This version: fn foo<T: Trait>() -> T { is similar, but also different. You, the caller, provide the type you want, T , and then the function returns it. You can see this in Rust today with things like parse or collect: let x: i32 = \"5\".parse()?;\nlet x: u64 = \"5\".parse()?; Here, .parse has this signature: pub fn parse<F>(&self) -> Result<F, <F as FromStr>::Err> where F: FromStr, Same general idea, though with a result type and FromStr has an associated type... anyway, you can see how F is in the return position here. So you have the ability to choose. With impl Trait , you're saying \"hey, some type exists that implements this trait, but I'm not gonna tell you what it is.\" (\"existential\" in the jargon, \"some type exists\"). So now, the caller can't choose, and the function itself gets to choose. If we tried to define parse with Result<impl F,... as the return type, it wouldn't work."},"2018/transitioning/raw-identifiers.html#more-details":{"id":"2018/transitioning/raw-identifiers.html#more-details","title":"More details","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Transitioning to Rust 2018 » More details","body":"This feature is useful for a few reasons, but the primary motivation was inter-edition situations.

These two forms are almost the same: trait Trait {} fn foo(arg: impl Trait) {\n} fn foo<T: Trait>(arg: T) {\n} That is, it's a slightly shorter syntax for a generic type parameter. It means, \" arg is an argument that takes any type that implements the Trait trait.\" However, there's also an important technical difference between T: Trait and impl Trait here. When you write the former, you can specify the type of T at the call site with turbo-fish syntax as with foo::<usize>(1) . In the case of impl Trait , if it is used anywhere in the function definition, then you can't use turbo-fish at all. Therefore, you should be mindful that changing both from and to impl Trait can constitute a breaking change for the users of your code.","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Transitioning to Rust 2018 » Trait system » Argument Position"},"2018/transitioning/concurrency/async-await.html#asyncawait":{"body":"Async/await has not been implemented in the compiler yet.","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Transitioning to Rust 2018 » Concurrency additions » async/await","title":"async/await","id":"2018/transitioning/concurrency/async-await.html#asyncawait"},"2018/transitioning/raw-identifiers.html#try":{"body":"The do catch { .. } blocks have been renamed to try { .. } and to support that, the keyword try will is reserved in edition 2018.

The trait is defined as: pub trait Termination { fn report(self) -> i32;\n} When setting up the entry point for your application, the compiler will use this trait and call .report() on the Result of the main function you have written. Two simplified example implementations of this trait for Result and () are: # #![feature(process_exitcode_placeholder, termination_trait_lib)]\n# use std::process::ExitCode;\n# use std::fmt;\n#\n# pub trait Termination { fn report(self) -> i32; } impl Termination for () { fn report(self) -> i32 { # use std::process::Termination; ExitCode::SUCCESS.report() }\n} impl<E: fmt::Debug> Termination for Result<(), E> { fn report(self) -> i32 { match self { Ok(()) => ().report(), Err(err) => { eprintln!(\"Error: {:?}\", err); # use std::process::Termination; ExitCode::FAILURE.report() } } }\n} As you can see in the case of () , a success code is simply returned.
