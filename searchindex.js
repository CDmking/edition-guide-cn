With the release of Rust 1.0 and Rust 2015, we committed to backwards compatibility, ensuring a solid foundation for people to build projects on top of.

For those who write many small programs and, hopefully, many tests, one common paper cut has been mixing entry points such as main and #[test] s with error handling. As an example, you might have tried to write: use std::fs::File; fn main() { let f = File::open(\"bar.txt\")?;\n} Since ? works by propagating the Result with an early return to the enclosing function, the snippet above does not work, and results today in the following error: error[E0277]: the `?` operator can only be used in a function that returns `Result` or `Option` (or another type that implements `std::ops::Try`) --> src/main.rs:5:13 |\n5 | let f = File::open(\"bar.txt\")?; | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot use the `?` operator in a function that returns `()` | = help: the trait `std::ops::Try` is not implemented for `()` = note: required by `std::ops::Try::from_error` To solve this problem in Rust 2015, you might have written something like: // Rust 2015 # use std::process;\n# use std::error::Error; fn run() -> Result<(), Box<Error>> { // real logic.. Ok(())\n} fn main() { if let Err(e) = run() { println!(\"Application error: {}\", e); process::exit(1); }\n} However, in this case, the run function has all the interesting logic and main is just boilerplate. The problem is even worse for #[test] s, since there tend to be a lot more of them. In Rust 2018 you can instead let your #[test] s and main functions return a Result : // Rust 2018 use std::fs::File; fn main() -> Result<(), std::io::Error> { let f = File::open(\"bar.txt\")?; Ok(())\n} In this case, if say the file doesn't exist and there is an Err(err) somewhere, then main will exit with an error code (not 0 ) and print out a Debug representation of err .","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Transitioning to Rust 2018 » Error Handling » ? in fn main() and #[test] s","id":"2018/transitioning/errors/question-mark.html#a--in--fn-main--and--test-s","title":"? in fn main() and #[test] s"},"2018/transitioning/errors/question-mark.html#more-details":{"body":"Getting -> Result<..> to work in the context of main and #[test] s is not magic. It is all backed up by a Termination trait which all valid return types of main and testing functions must implement. The trait is defined as: pub trait Termination { fn report(self) -> i32;\n} When setting up the entry point for your application, the compiler will use this trait and call .report() on the Result of the main function you have written. Two simplified example implementations of this trait for Result and () are: # #![feature(process_exitcode_placeholder, termination_trait_lib)]\n# use std::process::ExitCode;\n# use std::fmt;\n#\n# pub trait Termination { fn report(self) -> i32; } impl Termination for () { fn report(self) -> i32 { # use std::process::Termination; ExitCode::SUCCESS.report() }\n} impl<E: fmt::Debug> Termination for Result<(), E> { fn report(self) -> i32 { match self { Ok(()) => ().report(), Err(err) => { eprintln!(\"Error: {:?}\", err); # use std::process::Termination; ExitCode::FAILURE.report() } } }\n} As you can see in the case of () , a success code is simply returned. In the case of Result , the success case delegates to the implementation for () but prints out an error message and a failure exit code on Err(..) .

Consider this code in Rust 2015: // Rust 2015 extern crate futures; mod submodule { // this works! use futures::Future; // so why doesn't this work? fn my_poll() -> futures::Poll { ... }\n} fn main() { // this works let five = std::sync::Arc::new(5);\n} mod submodule { fn function() { // ... so why doesn't this work let five = std::sync::Arc::new(5); }\n} In the futures example, the my_poll function signature is incorrect, because submodule contains no items named futures ; that is, this path is considered relative. But because use is absolute, use futures:: works even though a lone futures:: doesn't! With std it can be even more confusing, as you never wrote the extern crate std; line at all. So why does it work in main but not in a submodule? Same thing: it's a relative path because it's not in a use declaration. extern crate std; is inserted at the crate root, so it's fine in main , but it doesn't exist in the submodule at all. Let's look at how this change affects things: // Rust 2018 // no more `extern crate futures;` mod submodule { // 'futures' is the name of a crate, so this is absolute and works use futures::Future; // 'futures' is the name of a crate, so this is absolute and works fn my_poll() -> futures::Poll { ... }\n} fn main() { // 'std' is the name of a crate, so this is absolute and works let five = std::sync::Arc::new(5);\n} mod submodule { fn function() { // 'std' is the name of a crate, so this is absolute and works let five = std::sync::Arc::new(5); }\n} Much more straightforward.","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Transitioning to Rust 2018 » Module system » Absolute paths begin with crate or the crate name","id":"2018/transitioning/modules/path-clarity.html#absolute-paths-begin-with--crate--or-the-crate-name","title":"Absolute paths begin with crate or the crate name"},"2018/transitioning/modules/path-clarity.html#more-details":{"body":"Let's talk about each new feature in turn.","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Transitioning to Rust 2018 » Module system » More details","id":"2018/transitioning/modules/path-clarity.html#more-details","title":"More details"},"2018/transitioning/modules/path-clarity.html#no-more--extern-crate":{"body":"This one is quite straightforward: you no longer need to write extern crate to import a crate into your project.

Here's a brief summary: extern crate is no longer needed Absolute paths begin with a crate name, where the keyword crate refers to the current crate. The crate keyword also acts as a visibility modifier, equivalent to today's pub(crate) .

Instead, where you previously wrote -> StrWrap , you should now write -> StrWrap<'_> , making clear that borrowing is occurring. What exactly does '_ mean? It depends on the context! In output contexts, as in the return type of make_wrapper , it refers to a single lifetime for all \"output\" locations. In input contexts, a fresh lifetime is generated for each \"input location\". More concretely, to understand input contexts, consider the following example: // Rust 2015 struct Foo<'a, 'b: 'a> { field: &'a &'b str,\n} impl<'a, 'b: 'a> Foo<'a, 'b> { // some methods...\n} We can rewrite this as: #![feature(rust_2018_preview)] # struct Foo<'a, 'b: 'a> {\n# field: &'a &'b str,\n# } // Rust 2018 impl Foo<'_, '_> { // some methods...\n} This is the same, because for each '_ , a fresh lifetime is generated.

More formally, match has a \"binding mode\", which is one of move , ref , or ref mut . In Rust 2015, match always started in move mode, and required you to explicitly write ref or ref mut in patterns to switched to a borrowing mode. In Rust 2018, the type of the value being matched informs the binding mode, so that if you match against an &Option<&str> with a Some variant, you are put into ref mode automatically, giving you a borrowed view of the internal data.

However, with impl Trait : fn returns_closure() -> impl Fn(i32) -> i32 { |x| x + 1\n} We can now return closures by value, just like any other type!","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Transitioning to Rust 2018 » Trait system » impl Trait and closures","id":"2018/transitioning/traits/impl-trait.html#impl-trait--and-closures","title":"impl Trait and closures"},"2018/transitioning/traits/impl-trait.html#more-details":{"body":"The above is all you need to know to get going with impl Trait , but for some more nitty-gritty details: type parameters and impl Trait in argument position are universals (universally quantified types). Meanwhile, impl Trait in return position are existentials (existentially quantified types). Okay, maybe that's a bit too jargon-heavy. Let's step back. Consider this function: fn foo<T: Trait>(x: T) { When you call it, you set the type, T . \"you\" being the caller here. This signature says \"I accept any type that implements Trait.\" (\"any type\" == universal in the jargon) This version: fn foo<T: Trait>() -> T { is similar, but also different. You, the caller, provide the type you want, T , and then the function returns it. You can see this in Rust today with things like parse or collect: let x: i32 = \"5\".parse()?;\nlet x: u64 = \"5\".parse()?; Here, .parse has this signature: pub fn parse<F>(&self) -> Result<F, <F as FromStr>::Err> where F: FromStr, Same general idea, though with a result type and FromStr has an associated type... anyway, you can see how F is in the return position here. So you have the ability to choose. With impl Trait , you're saying \"hey, some type exists that implements this trait, but I'm not gonna tell you what it is.\" (\"existential\" in the jargon, \"some type exists\"). So now, the caller can't choose, and the function itself gets to choose. If we tried to define parse with Result<impl F,... as the return type, it wouldn't work.","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Transitioning to Rust 2018 » Trait system » More details","id":"2018/transitioning/traits/impl-trait.html#more-details","title":"More details"},"2018/transitioning/traits/impl-trait.html#return-position":{"body":"In return position, this feature is more interesting. It means \"I am returning some type that implements the Trait trait, but I'm not going to tell you exactly what the type is.\" Before impl Trait , you could do this with trait objects: trait Trait {} impl Trait for i32 {} fn returns_a_trait_object() -> Box<Trait> { Box::new(5)\n} However, this has some overhead: the Box<T> means that there's a heap allocation here, and this will use dynamic dispatch. But we only ever return one possible thing here, the Box<i32> . This means that we're paying for dynamic dispatch, even though we don't use it! With impl Trait , the code above could be written like this: trait Trait {} impl Trait for i32 {} fn returns_a_trait_object() -> impl Trait { 5\n} Here, we have no Box<T> , no trait object, and no dynamic dispatch. But we still can obscure the i32 return type. With i32 , this isn't super useful.
