Meanwhile, impl Trait in return position are existentials (existentially quantified types). Okay, maybe that's a bit too jargon-heavy. Let's step back. Consider this function: fn foo<T: Trait>(x: T) { When you call it, you set the type, T . \"you\" being the caller here. This signature says \"I accept any type that implements Trait.\" (\"any type\" == universal in the jargon) This version: fn foo<T: Trait>() -> T { is similar, but also different. You, the caller, provide the type you want, T , and then the function returns it. You can see this in Rust today with things like parse or collect: let x: i32 = \"5\".parse()?;\nlet x: u64 = \"5\".parse()?; Here, .parse has this signature: pub fn parse<F>(&self) -> Result<F, <F as FromStr>::Err> where F: FromStr, Same general idea, though with a result type and FromStr has an associated type... anyway, you can see how F is in the return position here. So you have the ability to choose. With impl Trait , you're saying \"hey, some type exists that implements this trait, but I'm not gonna tell you what it is.\" (\"existential\" in the jargon, \"some type exists\"). So now, the caller can't choose, and the function itself gets to choose. If we tried to define parse with Result<impl F,... as the return type, it wouldn't work.","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Transitioning to Rust 2018 » Trait system » More details","id":"2018/transitioning/traits/impl-trait.html#more-details"},"2018/transitioning/raw-identifiers.html#new-keywords":{"title":"New keywords","id":"2018/transitioning/raw-identifiers.html#new-keywords","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Transitioning to Rust 2018 » New keywords","body":"The new confirmed keywords in edition 2018 are:"},"introduction.html#introduction":{"title":"Introduction","body":"Welcome to the Rust Edition Guide! \"Editions\" are Rust's way of communicating large changes in the way that it feels to write Rust code.

The crate keyword also acts as a visibility modifier, equivalent to today's pub(crate) .

These two forms are almost the same: trait Trait {} fn foo(arg: impl Trait) {\n} fn foo<T: Trait>(arg: T) {\n} That is, it's a slightly shorter syntax for a generic type parameter. It means, \" arg is an argument that takes any type that implements the Trait trait.\" However, there's also an important technical difference between T: Trait and impl Trait here. When you write the former, you can specify the type of T at the call site with turbo-fish syntax as with foo::<usize>(1) . In the case of impl Trait , if it is used anywhere in the function definition, then you can't use turbo-fish at all. Therefore, you should be mindful that changing both from and to impl Trait can constitute a breaking change for the users of your code.","title":"Argument Position","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Transitioning to Rust 2018 » Trait system » Argument Position","id":"2018/transitioning/traits/impl-trait.html#argument-position"},"2018/transitioning/raw-identifiers.html#raw-identifiers":{"id":"2018/transitioning/raw-identifiers.html#raw-identifiers","body":"Rust, like many programming languages, has the concept of \"keywords\".
