After a while, all of those tiny changes add up. It can be hard to look back and say \"Wow, between Rust 1.10 and Rust 1.20, Rust has changed a lot!\" Furthermore, since everything must be backwards compatible, we can't make certain tiny changes, like adding keywords. Finally, various parts of the project, since they update at different paces, may feel like they \"lag\" in various ways. If a new language feature lands in Rust 1.15, and a new chapter of the book on it lands in 1.16, and the IDE integration lands in 1.17, this can feel very disjointed. But if you were to compare Rust 1.15 to Rust 1.17, you'd see one cohesive feature being added. \"Editions\" are a concept to help with these kinds of problems. Every two or three years, we'll be producing a new edition of Rust.

Consider this function: fn foo<T: Trait>(x: T) { When you call it, you set the type, T . \"you\" being the caller here. This signature says \"I accept any type that implements Trait.\" (\"any type\" == universal in the jargon) This version: fn foo<T: Trait>() -> T { is similar, but also different. You, the caller, provide the type you want, T , and then the function returns it. You can see this in Rust today with things like parse or collect: let x: i32 = \"5\".parse()?;\nlet x: u64 = \"5\".parse()?; Here, .parse has this signature: pub fn parse<F>(&self) -> Result<F, <F as FromStr>::Err> where F: FromStr, Same general idea, though with a result type and FromStr has an associated type... anyway, you can see how F is in the return position here. So you have the ability to choose. With impl Trait , you're saying \"hey, some type exists that implements this trait, but I'm not gonna tell you what it is.\" (\"existential\" in the jargon, \"some type exists\"). So now, the caller can't choose, and the function itself gets to choose.

But we only ever return one possible thing here, the Box<i32> . This means that we're paying for dynamic dispatch, even though we don't use it! With impl Trait , the code above could be written like this: trait Trait {} impl Trait for i32 {} fn returns_a_trait_object() -> impl Trait { 5\n} Here, we have no Box<T> , no trait object, and no dynamic dispatch.
