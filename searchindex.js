So, in Rust 2015, you'd write: fn two_args<'b>(arg1: &Foo, arg2: &'b Bar) -> &'b Baz In Rust 2018, you'd write: fn two_args(arg1: &Foo, arg2: &Bar) -> &'arg2 Baz Here, 'arg2 was not defined. Rust sees that you have a parameter, arg2 , that should have a lifetime, and so the lifetime of that reference. To put it in words, the former says: two_args is a function with one lifetime, 'b . Its first parameter is a reference to a Foo , , and its second parameter is a reference to a Bar , bound by the lifetime 'b , as its second argument. It returns a reference to a Baz bound by the lifetime 'b . And the latter says: two_args is a function. Its first parameter is a reference to a Foo , and its second parameter is a reference to a Bar . It returns a reference to a Baz with the same lifetime as the second parameter. This says what it means, as opposed to implying it. Instead of defining a lifetime, and then connecting things together, you say \"this is the lifetime of that.\"","id":"2018/transitioning/ownership-and-lifetimes/in-band-lifetimes.html#in-band-lifetimes","title":"In-band lifetimes","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Transitioning to Rust 2018 » Ownership and lifetimes » In-band lifetimes"},"2018/transitioning/modules/path-clarity.html#absolute-paths-begin-with--crate--or-the-crate-name":{"body":"Paths that begin with a crate name or crate are now considered absolute paths, rather than relative ones. crate is the current crate's crate root. Code that looked like this: extern crate futures; use futures::Future; mod foo { struct Bar;\n} use foo::Bar; Now looks like this: // 'futures' is the name of a crate\nuse futures::Future; mod foo { struct Bar;\n} // 'crate' means the current crate\nuse crate::foo::Bar; Described this way, it seems fairly small. But it creates a much more intuitive end result. Consider this code: extern crate futures; mod submodule { // this works! use futures::Future; // so why doesn't this work? fn my_poll() -> futures::Poll { ... }\n} fn main() { // this works let five = std::sync::Arc::new(5);\n} mod submodle { fn function() { // ... so why doesn't this work let five = std::sync::Arc::new(5); }\n} In the futures example, the my_poll function signature is incorrect, because submodule contains no items named futures ; that is, this path is considered relative. But because use is absolute, use futures:: works even though a lone futures:: doesn't! With std it can be even more confusing, as you never wrote the extern crate std; line at all. So why does it work in main but not in a submodule? Same thing: it's a relative path because it's not in a use declaration. extern crate std; is inserted at the crate root, so it's fine in main , but it doesn't exist in the submodule at all. Let's look at how this change affects things: // no more `extern crate futures;` mod submodule { // 'futures' is the name of a crate, so this is absolute and works use futures::Future; // 'futures' is the name of a crate, so this is absolute and works fn my_poll() -> futures::Poll { ... }\n} fn main() { // 'std' is the name of a crate, so this is absolute and works let five = std::sync::Arc::new(5);\n} mod submodle { fn function() { // 'std' is the name of a crate, so this is absolute and works let five = std::sync::Arc::new(5); }\n} Much more straightforward.","title":"Absolute paths begin with crate or the crate name","breadcrumbs":"Rust 2018 » Transitioning to Rust 2018 » Module system » Absolute paths begin with crate or the crate name","id":"2018/transitioning/modules/path-clarity.html#absolute-paths-begin-with--crate--or-the-crate-name"},"editions/transitioning.html#running-rustfix":{"body":"There are some lints that can help you prepare for the next edition, but they're not currently turned on by default. rustfix has your back though!

For those who write many small programs and, hopefully, many tests, one common paper cut has been mixing entry points such as main and #[test] s with error handling. As an example, you might have tried to write: use std::fs::File; fn main() { let f = File::open(\"bar.txt\")?;\n} Since ? works by propagating the Result with an early return to the enclosing function, the snippet above does not work, and results today in the following error: error[E0277]: the `?` operator can only be used in a function that returns `Result` or `Option` (or another type that implements `std::ops::Try`) --> src/main.rs:5:13 |\n5 | let f = File::open(\"bar.txt\")?; | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot use the `?` operator in a function that returns `()` | = help: the trait `std::ops::Try` is not implemented for `()` = note: required by `std::ops::Try::from_error` To solve this in edition 2015, you might have written something like: # use std::process;\n# use std::error::Error; fn run() -> Result<(), Box<Error>> { // real logic.. Ok(())\n} fn main() { if let Err(e) = run() { println!(\"Application error: {}\", e); process::exit(1); }\n} However, in this case, the run function has all the interesting logic and main is just boilerplate. When you write many #[test] s, this can become a problem. In edition 2018, you can instead let your #[test] s and main functions return a Result . use std::fs::File; fn main() -> Result<(), std::io::Error> { let f = File::open(\"bar.txt\")?; Ok(())\n} In this case, if say the file doesn't exist and there is an Err(err) somewhere, then main will exit with an error code (not 0 ) and print out a Debug representation of err .","title":"? in fn main() and #[test] s","id":"2018/transitioning/errors/question-mark.html#a--in--fn-main--and--test-s"},"2018/transitioning/errors/question-mark.html#more-details":{"body":"Getting -> Result<..> to work in the context of main and #[test] s is no magic. It is all backed up by a Termination trait which all valid return types of main and testing functions must implement. The trait is defined as: pub trait Termination { fn report(self) -> i32;\n} When setting up the entry point for your application, the compiler will use this trait and call .report() on the Result of the main function you have written. Two simplified example implementations of this trait for Result and () are: # #![feature(process_exitcode_placeholder, termination_trait_lib)]\n# use std::process::ExitCode;\n# use std::fmt;\n#\n# pub trait Termination { fn report(self) -> i32; } impl Termination for () { fn report(self) -> i32 { # use std::process::Termination; ExitCode::SUCCESS.report() }\n} impl<E: fmt::Debug> Termination for Result<(), E> { fn report(self) -> i32 { match self { Ok(()) => ().report(), Err(err) => { eprintln!(\"Error: {:?}\", err); # use std::process::Termination; ExitCode::FAILURE.report() } } }\n} As you can see in the case of () , a success code is simply returned.

Consider this function: fn foo<T: Trait>(x: T) { When you call it, you set the type, T . \"you\" being the caller here. This signature says \"I accept any type that implements Trait.\" (\"any type\" == universal in the jargon) This version: fn foo<T: Trait>() -> T { is similar, but also different. You, the caller, provide the type you want, T , and then the function returns it. You can see this in Rust today with things like parse or collect: let x: i32 = \"5\".parse()?;\nlet x: u64 = \"5\".parse()?; Here, .parse has this signature: pub fn parse<F>(&self) -> Result<F, <F as FromStr>::Err> where F: FromStr, Same general idea, though with a result type and FromStr has an associated type... anyway, you can see how F is in the return position here. So you have the ability to choose. With impl Trait , you're saying \"hey, some type exists that implements this trait, but I'm not gonna tell you what it is.\" (\"existential\" in the jargon, \"some type exists\"). So now, the caller can't choose, and the function itself gets to choose.
