# Module system

The module system is one of the most confusing aspects of Rust 2015 for many
Rustaceans. Rust 2018 includes an overhaul of the module system. In the
words of the core team:

> In other words, while there are simple and consistent rules defining the
module system, their consequences can feel inconsistent, counterintuitive and
mysterious.

Rust 2018's module system also consists of simple rules, but they fit
together in a much nicer way. We expect these changes to be one of the
favorites in this edition.
